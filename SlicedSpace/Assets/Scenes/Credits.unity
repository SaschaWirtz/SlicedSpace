    or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object
    code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.\r\n\r\n   
    \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
    made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
    included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\r\n\r\n   
    \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
    is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original
    work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall
    not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name)
    to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n    \"Contribution\"

    and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
    to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
    form.\r\n\r\n    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
    section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
    and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent
    claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work
    to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
    that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
    under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
    is filed.\r\n\r\n    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies
    of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
    and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n   
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
    of this License; and\r\n\r\n    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry
    prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n    (c) You
    must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
    all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
    of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works; and\r\n\r\n    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part
    of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
    a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
    in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
    provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
    contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify
    the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
    that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
    Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
    modifying the License.\r\n\r\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to
    Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
    conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution
    of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall
    be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n    6. Trademarks. This License does not
    grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
    names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
    or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
    solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
    this License.\r\n\r\n    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no
    legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
    or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages

    1. Definitions\r\n\r\n\"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical
    issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified
    form, along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent
    works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
    a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
    for the purposes of this License.\"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon
    the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
    musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
    sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form
    in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work
    that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
    musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
    with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
    purpose of this License.\"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity

    the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce
    the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;to create and reproduce Derivative
    Works provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any
    medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could
    be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a
    modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";;to distribute
    copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly
    by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
    Collective Works;to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform

    whether individually or, in the event that Licensor is a member of a performance

    public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.Mechanical
    Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
    whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry
    Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover
    version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
    Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).Webcasting
    Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
    a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
    or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public
    digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license
    created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
    jurisdictions).The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
    now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
    modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
    and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\r\n\r\n   
    1. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
    to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nYou may distribute, publicly
    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
    the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not
    offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License
    or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
    must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
    of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on
    the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
    not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
    to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
    Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative
    Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
    from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.If
    You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
    the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as defined
    in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above), You
    must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
    copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
    You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)
    if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another
    party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or
    by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the
    Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
    Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
    the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French
    translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original
    Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented
    in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative
    Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for
    all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then
    as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may
    not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship
    or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.5.

    NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,

    LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
    OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n    2. Termination\r\n\r\nThis License and the rights
    granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
    terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works
    (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1
    above) from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.Subject
    to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
    the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
    Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms
    or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
    been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.8.

    Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section
    1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.Each time
    You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
    as the license granted to You under this License.If any provision of this License
    is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
    or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without
    further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed
    to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.No
    term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented
    to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party
    to be charged with such waiver or consent.This License constitutes the entire
    agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are
    no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not
    specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without
    the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n\r\n\r\nComponent Name:

    goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of
    collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic
    and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
    fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.\r\n\r\nThe OFL allows
    the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as
    long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative
    works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software
    provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts
    and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.
    The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any
    document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Font
    Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under
    this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build
    scripts and documentation.\r\n\r\n\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names
    specified as such after the copyright statement(s).\r\n\r\n\"Original Version\"
    refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
    Holder(s).\r\n\r\n\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding
    to, deleting, or substituting \u2014 in part or in whole \u2014 any of the components
    of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software
    to a new environment.\r\n\r\n\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer,
    technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software. PERMISSION
    & CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
    obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
    redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject
    to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its
    individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\r\n\r\n2)
    Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed
    and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright
    notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
    human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields
    within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the
    user.\r\n\r\n3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved
    Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented
    to the users.\r\n\r\n4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s)
    of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified
    Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
    and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.\r\n\r\n5) The Font
    Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely
    under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document
    created using the Font Software.\r\n\r\nTERMINATION\r\n\r\nThis license becomes
    null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nTHE
    FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
